# Capital
Capital is a completely proxyless Roblox asset downloader. You can download Decals/Models/Audios/Videos/Animations etc.
# Instructions [WINDOWS]
```
‣ Download the ZIP file, then extract it to a location you wish to.
‣ Edit the "ids.txt" file. Paste all your asset ID's here with a linebreak.
‣ Run the executable. You might have issues with your anti-virus, if so, please disable it or add an exclusion for the executable.
‣ Choose a mode.
‣ Choose the amount of threads.
‣ All done! It will now check all the ID's specified.
```
# Note
This project is poorly made as there was not a lot of time spent on it, but it works nevertheless. It should perform decently and finish checking ID's fast. It all depends on the amount though. Errors are written to errors.txt. All binaries are for the amd64 architecture, for running it on ARM64/PowerPC/x86/ARMHF etc. architectures, you will have to run it from source.
# Credits
1carus for helping me build it for Windows (I don't have a Windows machine) and Shidposter for the idea.
